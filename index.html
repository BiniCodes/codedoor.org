            Refugee children like Hany speak of education as the most important thing in their lives.<br/>
            Traumatized from the horrors they have witnessed, uprooted and forced from their homes, school can help refugee children and young people reclaim their futures.<br/><br/>
            But right now, with millions of children, women and men in need UNHCR is struggling to meet all of the immediate needs of refugees across the world. With such limited resources, secondary schooling becomes a rare opportunity. University becomes a luxury. Even primary school children are often forced to choose between school and earning an income to help their family survive.
