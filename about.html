          <p class="quote">It started as a side-project. We saw a social-problem right in front of our doorstep: Refugee-children and -youth who came to Germany are in urgent need to access secondary- and college-level education. <br> 
The problem also exists on a global scale: in total 50 million refugees have no access to high-quality education. <br>
We expected that at least in Germany refugees would receive laptops that allow access to online education apps.  However, to our surprise, this is not the case. <br>
So we started to work on an educational system to improve access to education for refugees, and for now in particular to help them to learn how to code. Our system is designed to take concepts that are proven winners (crowdfunding & browser-based learning & open source) and puts them in a package that local authorities can easily use.<br></p>
