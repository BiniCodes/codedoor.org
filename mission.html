    <h1>Our mission</h1>
		We're a non-profit organisation compassionately preparing and educating refugees to become software developers by providing them with tutors, material and environment to learn efficiently.
		This education will support their sustainable integration into this new society and prepare them when they will be able to return home.

			With CodeDoor, we set out to do the impossible: engineer a system to help refugees and others in need to thrive.
			That means reimagining every step to make the educational process not only working but incredibly effective.
			The result is more than just a website that enables refugees to learn how to code. It's a chance for a sustainable integration into this new society.

			<header>How we do it</header>
			Our mission consists of 2 steps. The first part is to gather material, content and volunteers to setup an effective education environment.<br />
			We get devices (laptops, desktops, screens, etc...) from donors.<br />
			We collaborate with volunteers working in the IT industry providing us with content and requirements from the IT companies.<br />
			We create a program of curated courses that the students should follow.<br />
			When finishing a program, the participant is rewarded with a certificate and a device (laptop or desktop, depending on our stock), to allow him to work independently and immediatly.<br />
			We train volunteers to become tutors for the students. They will track the progress and help the student to reach his goal.<br /><br />
			Once the environment is setup, the students can start the programs.
