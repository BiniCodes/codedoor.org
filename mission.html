			We are a non-profit organisation compassionately preparing and educating refugees to become software developers by providing them with tutors, material and environment to learn efficiently.
			This education will support their sustainable integration into this new society and prepare them when they will be able to return home.

			<header>Our approch</header>
			To reach our goal, we decided to divide our work into two different parts.<br />
			The first part is to gather material, content and volunteers to <b>setup an effective education environment</b>:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>* We get <b>devices</b> (laptops, desktops, screens, etc...) from donors.</li>
				<li>* We collaborate with volunteers working in the IT industry providing us with <b>content</b> and requirements from the IT companies.</li>
				<li>* We create a program of <b>curated courses</b> that the students can follow.</li>
			</ul>
				<br />
				Once the optimal working environment is setup, we <b>launch the program</b> with a batch of selected refugees.<br />
				They follow our <b>curriculum of courses</b>, pass tests and present projects during the program. The <b>final project</b> is to build a web application from A to Z.<br />
				When they finish the program sucessfuly, the participant is <b>rewarded with a certificate</b> and a device (laptop or desktop, depending on our stock), to allow him to work independently and immediatly.</li>
				During the progam, the student are helped by <b>tutors</b>, trained by CodeDoor. The tutors are here to follow the progress, help the student to reach his goal and keep his motivation up.<br />
