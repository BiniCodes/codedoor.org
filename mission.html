					<p class="quote"> Our Mission <br> With CodeDoor, we set out to do the impossible: engineer a system to help refugees and others in need to thrive.  That meant reimagining every step to make the educational process not only working but incredibly effective. The result is more than just a website that enables refugees to learn how to code. Itâ€™s means the future for some refugees.</p>
