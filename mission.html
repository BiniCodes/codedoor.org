			We're a non-profit organisation compassionately preparing and educating refugees to become software developers by providing them with tutors, material and environment to learn efficiently.
			This education will support their sustainable integration into this new society and prepare them when they will be able to return home.

			<header>Our approch</header>
			To reach our goal, we decided to divide our work into two different parts:
			The first part is to gather material, content and volunteers to <b>setup an effective education environment</b>.<br />
			We get devices (laptops, desktops, screens, etc...) from donors.<br />
			We collaborate with volunteers working in the IT industry providing us with content and requirements from the IT companies.<br />
			We create a program of curated courses that the students should follow.<br />
			When finishing a program, the participant is rewarded with a certificate and a device (laptop or desktop, depending on our stock), to allow him to work independently and immediatly.<br />
			We train volunteers to become tutors for the students. They will track the progress and help the student to reach his goal.<br /><br />
			Once the environment is setup, the students can start the programs.
