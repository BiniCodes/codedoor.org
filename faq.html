            <h4>What is CodeDoor?</h4>
            CodeDoor is an organization that enables anyone to donate a used but operational laptop or PC directly to refugees. The refugees learn how to code with the curation of tutors that we train.

            <h4>Why do you want refugees to code? Don't they need a safe place, water and food and clothing first?</h4>
            Refugee camps cover most of the needs: water, food, clothing and a safe place to live. But there is almost never a solution how to safeguard education for refugees.  We believe, that helping refugees to learn how to code will make the most use of existing resources and provide refugees with a globally needed skill.

            <h3>Questions regarding Donations</h3>

            <h4>How do I donate a laptop, PC or Ipad?</h4>
            Just send us some information about your device and we will get back to you asap to schedule a pickup. To do so please take your time and fill out this form. Please bear in mind that we can accept working devices only.

            <h4>Do all donations go directly to the refugees?</h4>
            Yes, the device will go directly to the refugee. We do not sell your device or use it for our operations. We document everything in our transparency document.


            <h4>I live in the US / in the EU can I donate my used but working laptop, PC or Ipad?</h4>
            We are currently in negotiations with carriers to provide special rates for pickups in the EU and the US. Currently we offer in cooperation with Packlink a 10% discount for all shipments within Germany.

            <h4>How does CodeDoor fund its daily operations?</h4>
            Our operating expenses are currently covered by ourselves. But if CodeDoor keeps growing as it does, we will need donations. We plan to be 100% sustainable in 3-5 years.  We document every cash donation in our transparency document.


            <h3>Questions regarding the Students</h3>

            <h4>Who receives the laptops, PCs etc.?</h4>
            In order to be eligible for receiving a laptop or PC the students must show the willingness to learn how to code and to own a device must be financially unreachable for the refugee.

            <h4>Who decides which refugees receive a device?</h4>
            When refugee camp authorities send us the refugee profiles, we check if they meet our criteria for donation. We often cannot meet with the refugees ourselves and trust the authorities that they are choosing the ones that really want to learn how to code.
