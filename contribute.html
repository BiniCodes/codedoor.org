                        The refugees needs laptops and devices to work efficiently. If you have an old but operational laptop that you don't use, you can help a student join the program.
                        <br> Every laptop will be refurbished, the data will be completely erased and Linux Mint will be installed.
                        <br> Thanks to our partner Packlink, you can send us the laptop for less than 5â‚¬. Use the following link for more information:<br>

                        <br> In Frankfurt and Berlin we can also pick up the device directly at your home or office.<br>Just <a href="mailto:gee@codedoor.org">contact us</a>.

                        <h3>You love your field and want to share your knowledge</h3>
                        Studying online is hard. You need a strong motivation and a good autonomy.<br>
                        Each student will be assisted by a tutor. They will meet online or in an office every week to ask/answer questions, explain their current work and their impediments.<br>
                        The tutors will need some experience with development (full-stack javascript) but don't need to be a specialist since we have a big community to help answer technical questions.<br><br>

                        The students, tutors and IT professional communicate on a platform where they can share, ask and discuss about different topics. Codedoor also needs to build internal tools to manage the organisation.<br>
                        All the tools built will be <a href="https://github.com/CodeDoorHQ" target="_blank">made open-source</a>.<br>
                        We plan to use javascript for the frontend and the backend. MeteorJS seems to be a good candidate but we are open to any suggestion.</a><br>
